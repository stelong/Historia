    # Appendix - Wave object loading
    # You can load a wave object by providing the same data used to instantiate the wave: emulator, Itrain, cutoff, maxno, mean, var. This is normally done when you need to re-run the wave differently.
    # Alternatively, you can load the wave object by providing no data at all, just to better examine its internal structure:
    W = hm.Wave()
    W.load(f"./wave_{waveno}")
    W.print_stats()

    # This is the list of the loaded wave object attributes:
    print(W.__dict__.keys())

    # Noteworthy attributes are:
    # W.I = implausibility measure obtained for each point in the test set
    # W.NIMP = non-implausible region
    # W.nimp_idx = indices of the initial test set which resulted to be non-implausible
    # W.IMP = implausible region
    # W.imp_idx = indices of the initial test set which resulted to be implausible
    # W.simul_idx = indices of W.NIMP that were selected to be simulated for the next wave
    # W.nsimul_idx = indices of W.NIMP which were not selected for simulations (the respective points will appear in the test set of the next wave instead)

    # The original test set is not stored as an attribute to save space. However, this information can still be retrieved from stored attributes as:
    # X_test = W.reconstruct_tests()
